Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) lets you use your own AI API key instead of the default AI configuration provided by Mysamantha.

This feature is optional and intended for advanced users.

## **What BYOK Does**

With BYOK, you can:

- Connect your own AI API key
- Select the AI model you prefer
- Control usage limits and costs directly through your provider

## **How to Set Up BYOK**

1. Open **Mysamantha**
2. Go to **Profile → Settings**
3. Select **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**
4. Paste your AI API key
5. Choose your preferred model
6. Save your settings

Once saved, Mysamantha uses your key for AI-related actions.

## **How BYOK Works**

When BYOK is enabled:

- AI actions use your API key instead of the default configuration
- Usage, limits, and costs are handled by your AI provider
- Mysamantha does not apply AI credit limits to BYOK usage

You can switch back at any time.

## **Cost & Usage**

- AI usage is billed directly by your AI provider
- Mysamantha does not add extra charges for BYOK usage
- You manage quotas and spending outside the app

## **Privacy & Security**

- Your API key is stored securely
- Keys are never shared or exposed
- Your data is not used to train AI models
- You can remove or replace your key anytime

## **Disabling BYOK**

To stop using your own key:

- Go to **Settings → BYOK**
- Remove your API key
- Save changes

Mysamantha will return to the default AI setup.

## **Limitations**

- Requires a valid API key
- Behavior depends on the selected model
- Availability of features may vary by provider
