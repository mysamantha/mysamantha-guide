Notification Rules help you control **what interrupts you** and **what can wait**.

You decide the signals that matter.\
Samantha handles the rest quietly.

## **Three Ways to Create Notification Rules**

Choose whichever feels easiest at the moment.\
All methods create the same kind of rule.

### **1. Directly from Samantha (Text or Voice)**

Just say what you want to be notified about.

Examples:

- “Notify me if any client says invoice.”
- “Alert me for messages from John only.”
- “Let me know if someone mentions reschedule.”

Samantha understands and creates the rule for you.

### **2. From the Chat Menu**

You can also create rules from an existing message.

1. Open a message in chat
2. Tap the **three-dot menu**
3. Select **Notification Rules → Add new**

This is useful when you want a rule based on something you’re already reading.

### **3. From Account Center**

You can manage everything from one place.

1. Go to **Account Center**
2. Open **App Settings → Notifications**
3. Select **Notification Rules**

Here you can view, edit, pause, or delete rules.

## **Keywords That Protect Your Mind and Time**

You don’t need notifications for:

- Every email
- Every newsletter
- Every app message

You only need alerts for what truly matters.

Common examples:

- “urgent”
- “invoice”
- “reschedule”
- “deadline”
- “fees”
- A client’s name
- “doctor”

## **What Happens When a Rule Triggers**

When a rule’s condition is met:

- Samantha sends you a notification
- You see exactly what triggered it
- You can act immediately or later

## **When Life Quietens, Everything Is Still There**

Filtering does **not** delete anything.

You can still open:

- Full inboxes
- Newsletters
- Group chats
- Promotions

You just see them **when you choose**, not when they demand attention.

Silence isn’t absence.\
It’s permission - to think, work, breathe, parent, study, or rest.

## **Offline Behavior**

Notification Rules require an internet connection.

When offline:

- Rules don’t trigger
- Notifications resume when you reconnect

Your notes, to dos, and journals still work offline.

## **Privacy & Control**

- Rules monitor only what you explicitly define
- Data is encrypted
- Your data is never sold or used to train AI models
- You can edit or delete rules anytime

Samantha never creates rules on her own.
