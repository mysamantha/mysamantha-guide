Mysamantha is designed to keep working even when you’re not connected to the internet.\
Offline access lets you continue capturing and organizing your thoughts without interruption.

## **What Works Offline**

When you’re offline, you can still use all **core, non-AI features**.

You can:

- Create, edit, and view **Notes**
- Create, edit, and complete **To Dos**
- Write and browse **Journal entries**
- Organize content (pin, reorder, label)
- Attach files that are already on your device
- View previously synced content

Your work is saved locally on your device.

## **What Requires Internet Access**

Some features depend on live processing or external services and need an internet connection.

These include:

- Chatting with **Samantha**
- Smart Actions (summaries, explanations, conversions)
- Voice transcription
- Email, Calendar, and Maps integrations
- Travel planning and real-time searches
- Web search and notification rules

When offline, these features are temporarily unavailable.

## **What Happens to Your Changes**

While offline:

- All edits are stored locally
- Nothing is lost
- You can continue working normally on supported features

When you reconnect:

- Changes sync automatically
- Notes, to-dos, and journals update across devices
- No manual action is required

## **Offline Use Cases**

Offline access is useful when:

- You’re on a flight
- You’re traveling in low-signal areas
- You want distraction-free writing
- You’re saving ideas on the move
- Internet access is unreliable or restricted

You can focus on capturing thoughts first and refine them later.

## **Sync Behavior**

- Sync happens automatically when connectivity returns
- Conflicts are resolved in the background
- Your latest changes are preserved

Mysamantha is built to avoid duplicate or overwritten content during sync.

## **Privacy & Data Safety**

- Offline data is stored securely on your device
- Synced data remains encrypted
- Your data is never sold or used to train AI models
- You stay in control of what’s created and synced
