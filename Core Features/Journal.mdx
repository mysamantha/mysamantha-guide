Journals work offline.\
AI-powered assistance requires an internet connection.

## **Using Journal with Samantha**

You can manage journal entries through chat.

**Examples**

- “Add a journal entry for today.”
- “Show me my journal from last Monday.”
- “Summarize my recent journal entries.”

Samantha only acts when you ask.

## **Personality Traits**

As you journal over time, Samantha detects recurring patterns in how you think, feel, and reflect.\
These patterns help to form personality traits.

Journal entries provide:

- Language and tone patterns
- Emotional responses across days
- Repeated themes and reactions

A single entry doesn’t define anything.\
The more consistently you journal, the clearer and more accurate these traits become.

Personality traits describe tendencies, not labels, and update as your journaling evolves.

## **Offline Behavior**

When offline, you can:

- Write new journal entries
- Edit existing entries
- Browse past entries

Sync happens automatically when you’re back online.

## **Privacy & Control**

- Journal entries are encrypted
- Journals are never sold or shared
- Journal content is not used to train AI models
- Journals cannot be publicly shared

You control access at all times. [more](https://mysamantha.ai/privacy)
