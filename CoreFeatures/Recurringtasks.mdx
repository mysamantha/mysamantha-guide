Transform one-time tasks into repeating habits. Whether it's a daily standup, weekly review, or monthly bill payment, set it once and Mysamantha handles the rest.

## What are Recurring Tasks?

Many tasks repeat regularly - paying bills every month, weekly team meetings, daily exercise, or yearly tax filing. Instead of creating the same task over and over, you can set up a recurring task that automatically creates the next occurrence when you complete it.

</Accordion>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Time-Based Recurring Tasks">
  You can add specific times to any recurring task:

  - Every Monday at 9 AM
  - Every first Friday at 10:30 AM
  - Every weekday at 8:30 AM
  - Every 2 weeks at 3 PM
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ending on a Specific Date:">
  - Every day until March 31
  - Every Monday ending December 15
  - Every week for 3 months
</Accordion>

## What doesn't work:

Some complex patterns aren't supported. Here are common ones and their workarounds:

**Different times for different days:**

NOT SUPPORTED: Every Monday at 8 PM and Tuesday at 9 PM

WORKAROUND: Create two separate tasks

**Multiple recurrence rules in one task:**

NOT SUPPORTED: Every Monday and every 1st of the month

WORKAROUND: Create two separate recurring tasks

## **Managing Recurring Tasks**

### **Completing a Recurring Task**

Each recurring task creates the next scheduled task automatically. Even if you don’t complete today’s task, the next one will still appear on the scheduled date. Uncompleted tasks are marked as overdue.

### **Editing a Recurring Task**

When you edit a recurring task, changes apply to all future occurrences. The recurrence pattern recalculates from today if you change the frequency or interval.

### Ending a Recurring Task

You can control when a recurring task stops repeating by choosing one of the following options:

- **Never** – the task continues indefinitely
- **On date** – the task ends on a specific date
- **After several occurrences** -  the task ends after several occurrences

### **Deleting a Recurring Task**

Deleting a recurring task removes all future occurrences. If you only want to delete one occurrence, complete it instead or convert it to a one-time task first.

## **Tips :**

### **Be Specific with Times**

Instead of "Every day", use "Every day at 9 AM" to build consistent habits

### **Use Weekdays for Work Tasks**

"Every weekday" is better than "Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."

### **Start Simple**

Begin with basic patterns like "Every Monday" before trying complex patterns

### **Use First for Bills**

For monthly bills, use "Every 1st" for consistent scheduling

<Tip>
  Open the **menu (⋮)** and select **Show all recurring instances** to see all upcoming occurrences of a recurring task in one place.
</Tip>
