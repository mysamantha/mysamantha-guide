## **Creating Tasks**

You can create tasks in multiple ways:

- Type directly in the To Do section
- Use voice to add a task.
- Ask Samantha to create a task from chat.
- Turn notes, emails, or conversations into tasks.

You don’t need to set everything up front. Details can be added or changed later.

## **Voice to Task**

**What it does**\
Creates tasks from spoken input.

**How to use**

- Tap the microphone
- Say your task naturally.
- The task is created with the detected details.

Free users can record up to **60 seconds**.\
Paid users can record up to **60 minutes**.

## **Smart Date Detection**

**What it does**\
Automatically detects dates and times from natural language.

**How it works**

- Say or type things like “tomorrow,” “next Monday,” or “at 5 PM.”
- Due dates are set automatically.

You can edit dates anytime.

## **Lists and Sections**

**What it does**\
Organizes tasks into structured groups.

**How to use**

- Create multiple lists (for example: Work, Personal, Learning)
- Divide lists into sections (for example: Urgent, Backlog, Ideas)

If no list is selected, tasks go into a global list by default.

## **Priorities**

**What it does**\
Helps you focus on what matters most.

**How to use**

## **Filters and Search**

You can manage tasks directly with the assistant.

**Examples**
