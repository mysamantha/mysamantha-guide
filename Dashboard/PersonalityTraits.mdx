This helps you see where you naturally lean in:

- Social energy and interaction
- Information processing
- Decision-making style
- Planning and structure preferences

## **How Traits Are Formed**

Personality Traits are built over time using patterns from across the app.

**They are based on:**

- **Journal entries** (primary signal)
- **Notes** you write
- **Tasks** you create and manage
- **Conversations with Samantha**

A single action does not define anything.\
Only repeated patterns contribute to insights.

## **How Personality Traits Help**

You can use these insights to:

- Plan work in ways that suit your natural style
- Communicate more clearly with others
- Understand what environments help you focus
- Reduce friction caused by forcing habits that don’t fit

The goal is alignment, not optimization.

## **What Personality Traits Are Not**

Personality Traits are:

- Not diagnoses
- Not permanent labels
- Not evaluations or scores

They are descriptive insights meant to support reflection and self-understanding.

## **Privacy & Control**

- Personality Traits are generated only from your own activity
- Your data is encrypted
- Insights are private and visible only to you
- Content is never sold or used to train AI models
