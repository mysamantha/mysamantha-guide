## What you can do with Assistant

- **Ask anything.** Get answers, explanations, ideas, or help thinking through a problem.
- **Create and manage content.** Tell Samantha to write a note, add a task, schedule a reminder, or start a journal entry without leaving chat.
- **Draft and rewrite.** Emails, messages, summaries, reports. Samantha writes to match your intent.
- **Search your own data.** Ask Samantha about your notes, tasks, or journal and she'll pull it up.
- **Use your own API key (BYOK).** Connect your own OpenAI or Anthropic key for extended usage.
- **Everything stays private.** Samantha only acts when you ask and never shares your data.
