## What you can do with Journal

- **Write freely.** Daily entries, quick check-ins, or longer reflections. No format required.
- **Log your mood** so you can see how you're feeling over days and weeks.
- **Get prompts from Samantha** when you're not sure what to write about.
- **Chat with your journal.** Ask Samantha to find patterns, summarize a period, or reflect back what you've written.
- **Track personal growth.** Look back at how your mindset, habits, and goals have shifted.
- **Everything is private.** Journal entries are encrypted and never shared.

## Who it's for

Journal is for people who want to be more intentional about their inner life. Whether you journal every day or just need a place to process something, Samantha helps you get more out of the habit.
