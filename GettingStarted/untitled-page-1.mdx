description: "Think, write, and organize with your AI assistant."

Samantha is the intelligence behind everything in Mysamantha. You can talk to her like a thinking partner — ask questions, give her tasks, have her write things, or let her manage your notes and to-dos directly from chat.

## What you can do with Assistant

- **Ask anything** — get answers, explanations, ideas, or help thinking through a problem
- **Create and manage content** — tell Samantha to write a note, add a task, schedule a reminder, or start a journal entry without leaving chat
- **Draft and rewrite** — emails, messages, summaries, reports — Samantha writes to match your intent
- **Search your own data** — ask Samantha about your notes, tasks, or journal and she'll pull it up
- **Use your own API key (BYOK)** — connect your own OpenAI or Anthropic key for extended usage
- **Everything stays private** — Samantha only acts when you ask, and never shares your data

## Who it's for

Assistant is for anyone who wants a second brain that actually does the work. Whether you're planning your week, writing something important, or just trying to think clearly — Samantha is the fastest way to get there.
