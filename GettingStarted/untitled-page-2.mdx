Journal in Mysamantha is your private space to reflect. It's more than a diary — Samantha helps you track how you're feeling, spot patterns over time, and turn your reflections into something meaningful.

## What you can do with Journal

- **Write freely** — daily entries, quick check-ins, or longer reflections — no format required
- **Log your mood** so you can see how you're feeling over days and weeks
- **Get prompts from Samantha** when you're not sure what to write about
- **Chat with your journal** — ask Samantha to find patterns, summarize a period, or reflect back what you've written
- **Track personal growth** — look back at how your mindset, habits, and goals have shifted
- **Everything is private** — journal entries are encrypted and never shared

## Who it's for

Journal is for people who want to be more intentional about their inner life. Whether you journal every day or just need a place to process something — Samantha helps you get more out of the habit.
