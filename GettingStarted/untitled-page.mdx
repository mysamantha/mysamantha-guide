Notes is your personal capture layer in Mysamantha. Whether you're jotting down a quick thought, recording your voice, or pasting in something you found online — Notes organizes it all automatically and makes it actionable.

## What you can do with Notes

- **Write or speak** your ideas — type freely or tap the mic and let Samantha transcribe for you
- **Auto-organize** — every note gets an AI-generated title and is sorted into a smart category (Work, Finance, Ideas, Health, and more)
- **Add labels** to group notes across projects or topics
- **Highlight any text** and ask Samantha to summarize, rewrite, turn it into tasks, draft an email, and more
- **Chat with a note** — open any note and talk to Samantha about it directly
- **Attach files** — images, audio, and documents stay linked to the note
- **Export** as PDF or HTML to share anytime
- **Works offline** — create and edit notes even without a connection

## Who it's for

Notes is built for anyone who thinks faster than they can organize. If you find yourself losing ideas, keeping too many browser tabs open, or copying things into apps that don't do anything with them — Notes fixes that.
