## **What Samantha Can Do**

With calendar access, Samantha can:

## **Handling Real-Life Planning**

You don’t need to think in “calendar terms.”

You can describe plans naturally, even when they include multiple steps or locations.

**For example:**\
“Next Friday evening pick up my girlfriend, stop for veggies, reach Mark’s place by 8.”

Samantha understands:

- The exact date
- Time constraints
- Multiple activities
- Related reminders

She creates the right calendar context, to dos, and reminders automatically.

## **Example Commands**

- “Add a meeting tomorrow at 3 PM called Project Review.”
- “Move my meeting with Alex from Friday to Monday.”
- “Schedule a call next week when I’m free.”
- “What’s on my calendar tomorrow?”

## **Memory & Context**

Samantha remembers:

- Past meetings
- Scheduling preferences
- Previous conversations related to events

This helps her plan better over time instead of starting fresh every time.

## **Offline Behavior**

Calendar actions require an internet connection.

## **Disconnecting Calendar**
