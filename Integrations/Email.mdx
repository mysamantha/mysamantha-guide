## **What Samantha Can Do with Email**

With email access, Samantha can:

- Monitor your inbox based on conditions you set
- Notify you when specific people reply or topics appear
- Draft and write emails for you
- Show every email for review before sending
- Schedule meetings directly from email conversations
- Detect calendar conflicts automatically
- Reschedule meetings when needed
- Turn multi-step plans into to dos, reminders, and calendar context
- Understand natural language instructions involving time, people, and locations
- Reference past emails, conversations, notes, and events when taking action

Samantha only takes action when you request it.

## **Handling Real-Life Planning (Email)**

You don’t need to think in email threads or action lists.

You can describe what needs to happen in plain language, even when it involves follow-ups, meetings, or multiple steps.

For example:\
“If John replies about funding, schedule a call next week when I’m free and remind me to prepare notes.”

Samantha understands:

- Who the email is from
- What the condition is (a reply, a topic, or a person)
- When an action should happen
- How it fits into your calendar and tasks

She creates the right reminders, meetings, and to dos automatically, and keeps everything in sync.

## **Example Commands**

- “Summarize this email thread.”
- “Reply and confirm the meeting.”
- “Schedule a call next week when I’m free.”
- “Remind me if they reply.”
- “Turn this email into tasks.”
