Samantha can help you with directions, planning, and time-aware suggestions.

## **How It Works**

The first time you open the Samantha chat, Mysamantha asks for permission to use your location.

You don’t need to go to Settings or trigger a specific command.

1. Open the **Samantha chat**
2. You’ll be asked to grant location permission
3. Tap **Allow** to continue

Once allowed, Samantha can use location context whenever it’s relevant.

## **If You Deny Location Access**

- If you deny location access once or twice, you may be asked again
- If you deny it more than two times, Samantha will stop asking

After that:

- If you ask something that needs location access, you’ll be redirected to your phone’s settings to enable it manually

## **Enabling Location Manually (If Blocked)**

If location access is blocked:

1. Open your phone **Settings**
2. Go to **Apps → Mysamantha**
3. Select **Permissions → Location**
4. Set access to **Allow**

Once enabled, Samantha can use location context again.

## **What Samantha Can Do**

With location access, Samantha can:

- Understand places mentioned in conversation
- Find nearby locations when you ask
- Estimate travel time between places
- Use travel time when scheduling or rescheduling
- Reference recent or saved places

Samantha only uses location data to perform actions you request.

## **Handling Real-Life Planning (Maps)**

You don’t need to think in routes or addresses.

You can describe plans naturally, even when they involve multiple places and timing.

For example:\
“Tomorrow evening, go to the gym, stop for groceries, then reach Mark’s place by 8.”

Samantha understands:

- The places involved
- The order of stops
- Time constraints
- Travel time between locations

She adds the right locations, reminders, and context automatically.

## **Example Commands**

- “Find coffee shops near my next meeting.”
- “How long will it take to reach the airport from home?”
- “Add this location to my meeting.”
- “Plan my route for this evening.”
- “Remind me when I’m close to the store.”

## **Using Maps with Other Features**

- Add locations to calendar events
- Combine travel time with scheduling
- Reference places mentioned in notes or emails

This keeps planning grounded in the real world.

## **Offline Behavior**

Location-based features require an internet connection.

When offline:

- Notes, to dos, and journals still work
- Location features resume once you reconnect

## **Privacy & Control**

- You’re asked for location permission when you enter the chat
- If denied repeatedly, you control access from device settings
- Location data is used only for actions you request
- Your data is encrypted
- Your data is never sold or used to train AI models
- You can revoke access anytime from your device settings
